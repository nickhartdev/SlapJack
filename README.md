# SlapJack
Mod1 Final Project

Project Outline: https://github.com/nickhartdev/SlapJack/projects/1

### Overview  

SlapJack is a single page application that recreates the card game SlapJack, otherwise known as ERS, that two players can play on the same computer using keyboard controls. The page was built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This project was done solo, and is a culmination of the knowledge I gained through my first quarter at the Turing School of Software and Design.

### Project Timeline and Resources  

I used GitHub projects for project planning alongside Git version control and ultimately completed the project in about 5 days, from planning to completion.

### Successes

  - **localStorage**: This was my first solo attempt at using localStorage - I understood the fundamentals, but learning how to implement them into the project firsthand was an incredibly rewarding experience.  
  - **Using Objects Effectively**: I had a huge revelation about halfway through building the game logic about how helpful objects are, and it ultimately accelerated my progress through the project exponentially.
  - **Interactive Debugging**: I challenged myself to use the debugger more often, and wow - it saved me so much time in the problem solving process.

### Challenges

  - **Focusing on one thing at a time**: I found it was so easy for me to get lost in all the different parts I could be working on. Project planning helped, and I feel better prepared for tackling projects like this in the future, but it took a lot of effort for me to focus on taking one step at a time. I found this ESPECIALLY true when refactoring my code towards the end.
  - **Seperation of Display Logic and Game Logic**: Prior to this project I didn't really have a clear understanding of how the two kinds of logic should be separated in my code. I feel like I understand these ideas better now, but it took a lot of trial and error within the project to figure things out.

### Progression

I broke the project up into 4 primary parts - setting the foundation of the page layout, building the game logic, connecting the game logic to the DOM, and then page styling.

**Page Layout**  

This part in the process was comprised of using HTML, CSS grid, and flexbox where needed to build the page's foundation. As a more visual person, I found that having the page skeleton as a reference helped me better develop my mental model for the project.

**Game Logic**  

I set a goal to be able to play the whole game in the browser console before tying it into the DOM. It was daunting looking at the whole picture, but once I started taking it step by step thinking about the steps you'd need to take to play the game (i.e. first you need to shuffle the deck, then deal the cards, etc.) the flow started to come in much more easily. I ultimately achieved my goal faster than anticipated, which felt very rewarding.

**Tying the Logic to the DOM**  

As mentioned above, my understanding of the seperation between the display logic and game logic was a little hazy up until this point. To my surprise, this portion ultimately ended up taking more time than developing the game logic. I'm very proud of the outcome, though - my whole project only has one event listener, and one global variable, both of which being metrics I worked to hold myself to. A lot of learning happened within this portion of the project.

**Page Styling**  

The styling for this page was pretty minimal. I set the background gradient, chose a font family, set some drop shadows for the cards, and that was it.
